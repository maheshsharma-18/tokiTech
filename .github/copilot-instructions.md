# Copilot Instructions for tokiTech

## Project Overview
- **tokiTech** is the official repository for the Toki Tech platform. The workspace currently contains documentation and design assets, but no source code or build/test scripts are present yet.
- The `docs/` directory holds product requirements (`prd.md`) and Figma design files for various user roles (Admin, classTeacher, FleetManagers, login_screens, principal, subjectTeacher).

## Key Directories & Files
- `docs/prd.md`: Product requirements and specifications.
- `docs/figma_designs/`: Contains subfolders for Figma design assets by user role.
- `README.md`: Brief project description. No build/test instructions or architecture details yet.

## AI Agent Guidance
- **No source code is present**. Focus on documentation, requirements, and design assets.
- If implementing features, reference `prd.md` for requirements and `figma_designs/` for UI/UX.
- When adding code, document architecture, workflows, and conventions in `README.md` and update this file.
- Use clear folder structures for new components, keeping documentation and assets organized by user role.
- If introducing build/test workflows, document all commands and conventions here and in `README.md`.

## Patterns & Conventions
- Organize new code and assets by user role, matching the structure in `figma_designs/`.
- Keep documentation up to date with any new features, workflows, or dependencies.
- Reference product requirements from `docs/prd.md` when implementing new features.

## External Integrations
- No integrations or dependencies are defined yet. Document any new ones clearly in this file and `README.md`.
